Buddha Air

This is an online Flight Booking App for Nepal's one of the top domestic airlines company Buddha Air. The specs were to build an online ticketing app by showcasing various flight schedules and destinations covered by the airlines along with the various blogs and magazines maintained by Buddha Air. The app also features the various types of tickets available.


I'm extremely pleased with how the project came out. I'm particularly proud with the app's animations, UI design and easily extended architecture. Buddha Air app was built with Xcode 10.1 and written entirely in Swift 4. It makes use of Auto layout for UI design and makes extensive use of UIView Animations and other third party libraries for animation.
